IDEAS
--Enemies--
Spider - Every few turns it lays eggs behind it.  The eggs are easy to kill, but if you don't deal with them they hatch into smaller spiders
Splitter - Large enemy (4x4).  When it dies, it splits into 2-4 smaller versions of itself.
Black Hole Enemy -- If a projectile would go to a square adjacent to it, that projectile instead targets this enemy's square
Bunnysaurus - Reuse my bunny sprite from my other game.  As it is walking, it eats nearby enemies and lays eggs when it does so. Eggs hatch into small bunnies.


--Spells--
Triangle Blast.  Target square is X range directly left or directly right of you.
  When you cast it, one projectile spawns at your target, and one spawns on the other side of you.
  The two projectiles travel in a line towards directly in front of you.

Rock Spikes - small spikes erupt from the ground in a line towards your target, dealing 1 damage on the way.
  When they hit your target, a giant spike erupts dealing more damage to the single square, and the 8 squares around
  the target get filled with "caltrops", which damage enemies entering them.

Skating Rink - Damages enemies in a 3x3 area.  Freezes any water or grass tiles in that area.
  When an enemy walks onto those squares, they are knocked down.

--Mechanics--
Instead of moving around the map, make it so you cast out of "crystals" that are around the map.
 Each crystal can cast a spell independently of the others
